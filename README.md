# LunAdd_China
This project focus on China market but I am also developing the foreign version.

# Development Environment & Library
MVP

This project is based on MVP framework (bascially...EaseMod's demo is used for the instant messaging part). Most of the structure reference to FastAndroid and BabyMaster which are open source project.

Material Design

Some v7 material design widgits are used.

Dagger2

DI works great with MVP so it is used in my project.

LeanCloud (BAAS provider)

LeanCloud is used for datastorage and push function. Originally I want to used LeanCloud for the non-china version but I found Leancloud only have one server outside china and it leads to degrade of service. Finally I decide to use Firebase for the foreign version but Leancloud is used for China version.

環信

Great BAAS provider and it has many server outside China. It is highly recommended.

Rxjava、RxAndroid

Greate Technic but I find it difficult to use.

Glide、Butterknife、Ucrop etc
